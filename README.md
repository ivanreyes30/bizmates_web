# UI/UX implementation and Code Implementation

#For the UI and UX implementation I used tailwindcss for the design to give the user a friendly graphical user interface and easy to read the codes for development. 

#For the code implementation of front-end application, I used the Vue JS Framework for creating a reusable component to use it in other views of the web application and for the API I used PHP Laravel Framework.

#I created an API key for the security purposes, to secure the returned data’s which will come from the FOURSQUARE AND OPENWEATHERMAP API. Due to the deprecation of https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search, I used the new version API of FOURSQUARE which is the PLACE API. The logic of the security of API is at the middleware section of the Laravel framework.
